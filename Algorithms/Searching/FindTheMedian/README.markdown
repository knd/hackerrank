## Fine the Median

In the Quicksort challenges, you sorted an entire array. Sometimes, you just need specific information about a list of numbers, and doing a full sort would be unnecessary. Can you figure out a way to use your partition code to find the median in an array?

**Challenge**

Given a list of numbers, can you find the median?

**Input Format**

There will be two lines of input:

* n - the size of the array
* ar - n numbers that makes up the array

**Output Format**

Output one integer, the median.

**Constraints**

1<= n <= 1000001
-10000 <= x <= 10000 , x ∈ ar 
There will be an odd number of elements.

**Sample Input**

		7
		0 1 2 4 6 5 3

**Sample Output**

		3
